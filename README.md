# WorkIndia_LibManagementSystem
This project is a Library Management System API using Flask and PostgreSQL. It enables user registration, book management, and secure bookings.
The project is a Library Management System API developed using the Flask web framework and PostgreSQL database. It offers a comprehensive set of features to manage library operations efficiently. Users can register and log in, with two distinct roles: Admin and Login Users. Admins have the authority to add and update books, while Login Users can browse the library, check book availability, and make bookings.

Book management is a core feature, allowing Admins to create new books by providing details such as title, author, and ISBN. All book information is securely stored in a PostgreSQL database. Users can search for books based on keywords in the title, and the system returns a list of matching books. Checking the availability of a specific book is also possible, with the system determining if the book is available for borrowing or already booked.

Booking books is another essential aspect of the system. Users can reserve a book for a specified period by providing the book's ID, their user ID, and the issue and return times. The system ensures that a book cannot be booked if it is already reserved by another user. Security measures include password hashing using bcrypt for user authentication and the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization. Admin API endpoints are protected with an API key to prevent unauthorized access.

The project integrates seamlessly with a PostgreSQL database to store user information, book details, and booking transactions. It also includes robust error handling to provide informative responses for scenarios such as missing parameters, incorrect credentials, or internal server errors. The project's design aims to create a secure and efficient library management system, enabling users to browse, book, and manage books while safeguarding data integrity and security.
